## Simple demonstration web application using Spring Boot, PostgreSql, freemarker, Spring Data JPA
To build a project, just go to the project folder and run the command:  

    mvn clean install

Then go to the **target** folder of the current project and run the application with the command:  
 
    java -jar homework-0.0.1.jar  
    
The database credentials are specified in the *{PROJECT_DIR}\src\main\resources\application.properties* file.
 
For the application to work properly, the database must already be created.
